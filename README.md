# myFirstrepo
I grew up in Ukraine
Grown up where the clump of cranberries
Every spring under the window bloomed,
I was amused by the white color.
Here the cornflowers in the hair wrapped up,
Here, my mother asked for tears,
To make my shirt embroider
Here I for the first time in my life I loved!
This is my land! This is my country!
Here is my family! Here is my family!
These are forests, fields, mountains and mountain valleys
You are my Ukraine! (all verse - 2)
Rye, wheat,
And the spring water flows here
We have the best girls in the world,
People are sincere, soul-rich.
Come to us in Ukraine
It is always welcomed here,
The song goes from house to house
Because our people can sing!
